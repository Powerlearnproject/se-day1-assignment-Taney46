# SE_Day1
## Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

# Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

## Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
### Software engineering is a disciplined process of applying engineering methods,principles and tools to design,develop and maintain high-quality software systems.

## Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
### -Development of new programming languages. These languages are more easier and user friendly to programmers e.g FORTAN
### -Establishment of software engineering in the 1960s as a discipline because of the constan emergence of complex software systems.
### -The advent of structured programming in the 1970s which promoted a methodology that emphasized readability, maintainability, and modularity.

## List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
### -Requirements gathering.This entails gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
### -Design.Involves creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
### -Implementation.Writing code and bulding a program that aligns withe the software design
### -Testing. This includes running the several tests on the software to ensure it meets the quality standard and functional requirements.
### -Deployment. The software is released to the customers
### -Maintenance.Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

## Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
### -Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach whereby the phases are distinct and followed strictly. It is applied in the aerospace industry, where there are strict regulations and defined requirements
### -Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It is used in web development projects where features and functionality can be added and modified in response to user feedback and business needs

## Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
### -Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
### -Quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
### -Project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

## Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
### These tools enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities e.g, Visual studio. IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g, Git

## What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
### -Tight deadlines. This can be overcomed by prioritizing tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
### -Changing requirements. This can be overcomed by ensuring there is effective communication between the client and the engineer.

## Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
### -Unit testing, involves testing individual components or modules of software
### -Integration testing is testing interactions between different components or subsystems
### -Acceptance testing includes testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
### Testing in general helps to identify and fix bug early in the development process, ensuring that software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.

# Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

## Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
### -Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or statements so as to achieve the desired output from AI models. It helps making questions more clear and specific to avoid getting confusing asnwers by asking vague questions

## Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
## -"What is the impact of aitificial intelligence"
## -"What is the impact of aitificial intelligence on software development"
### The second prompt will not give you a wide ranges of answers from different areas rather than impact of AI in software development. This is more time saving cause you will not have to go through a lot in search for the answer.
